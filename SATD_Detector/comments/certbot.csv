certbot/,48,a suitable DACL on Windows for Certbot can be found here:,
certbot/,49,https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/6356,
certbot/,50,"Basically, it states that appropriate permissions will be set for the owner, nothing for the",

certbot/,60,"on Python for Windows. So to be consistent on both platforms for Certbot, this method is",
certbot/,61,always forbidden.,
certbot/,68,The os.open function on Windows has the same effect as a call to os.chown concerning the file,
certbot/,69,"modes: these modes lack the correct control over the permissions given to the file. Instead,",
certbot/,70,filesystem.open invokes the Windows native API `CreateFile` to ensure that permissions are,
certbot/,71,"atomically set in case of file creation, or invokes filesystem.chmod to properly set the",

certbot/,79,"Very similarly to os.open, os.mkdir has the same effects on Windows and creates an unsecured",
