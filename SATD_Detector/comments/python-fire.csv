python-fire/fire/console/encoding.py,175,names/values is under user control on most systems. With one of those values,
python-fire/fire/console/encoding.py,176,in hand there is no way to tell exactly how the value was encoded. We get,
python-fire/fire/console/encoding.py,177,some reasonable hints from sys.getfilesystemencoding() or,
python-fire/fire/console/encoding.py,178,sys.getdefaultencoding() and use them to encode values that the receiving,
python-fire/fire/console/encoding.py,179,process will have a chance at decoding. Leaving the values as unicode,
python-fire/fire/console/encoding.py,180,strings will cause os module Unicode exceptions. What good is a language,
python-fire/fire/console/encoding.py,181,unicode model when the module support could care less?,
