ansible/lib/,103,,
ansible/lib/,104,Python 2.6 does not have subprocess.check_output so replicate it here,
ansible/lib/,105,,
ansible/lib/,141,Deviation from Python-2.7: Python-2.6's CalledProcessError does not,
ansible/lib/,142,have an argument for the stdout so simply omit it.,
ansible/lib/,704,updated later,
ansible/lib/,803,This algorithm uses the last version in priority order that has,
ansible/lib/,804,"the best precision. If the versions are not in conflict, that",
ansible/lib/,805,"does not matter; otherwise, using the last one instead of the",
ansible/lib/,806,first one might be considered a surprise.,
ansible/lib/,874,Handle os_release specially since distros might purposefully set,
ansible/lib/,875,this to empty string to have no codename,
ansible/lib/,1006,"The shlex module defines its `wordchars` variable using literals,",
ansible/lib/,1007,making it dependent on the encoding of the Python source file.,
ansible/lib/,1008,"In Python 2.6 and 2.7, the shlex source file is encoded in",
ansible/lib/,1009,"'iso-8859-1', and the `wordchars` variable is defined as a byte",
ansible/lib/,1010,string. This causes a UnicodeDecodeError to be raised when the,
ansible/lib/,1011,parsed content is a unicode object. The following fix resolves that,
ansible/lib/,1012,(... but it should be fixed in shlex...):,
ansible/lib/,1018,"At this point, all shell-like parsing has been done (i.e.",
ansible/lib/,1019,"comments processed, quotes and backslash escape sequences",
ansible/lib/,1020,"processed, multi-line values assembled, trailing newlines",
ansible/lib/,1021,"stripped, etc.), so the tokens are now either:",
ansible/lib/,1022,* variable assignments: var=value,
ansible/lib/,1023,* commands or their arguments (not allowed in os-release),
ansible/lib/,1030,Ignore any tokens that are not variable assignments,
ansible/lib/,1034,os-release added a version_codename field.  Use that in,
ansible/lib/,1035,preference to anything else Note that some distros purposefully,
ansible/lib/,1036,do not have code names.  They should be setting,
ansible/lib/,1037,"version_codename=""""",
ansible/lib/,1040,Same as above but a non-standard field name used on older Ubuntus,
ansible/lib/,1043,"If there is no version_codename, parse it from the version",
ansible/lib/,1050,codename appears within paranthese.,
ansible/lib/,1069,Command not found,
ansible/lib/,1092,Ignore lines without colon.,
ansible/lib/,1116,This is to prevent the Linux kernel version from,
ansible/lib/,1117,appearing as the 'best' version on otherwise,
ansible/lib/,1118,identifiable distributions.,
ansible/lib/,1135,"If it was specified, we use it and parse what we can, even if",
ansible/lib/,1136,its file name or content does not match the expected pattern.,
ansible/lib/,1140,The file name pattern for user-specified distro release files,
ansible/lib/,1141,is somewhat more tolerant (compared to when searching for the,
ansible/lib/,1142,"file), because we want to use what was specified as best as",
ansible/lib/,1143,possible.,
ansible/lib/,1154,We sort for repeatability in cases where there are multiple,
ansible/lib/,1155,"distro specific files; e.g. CentOS, Oracle, Enterprise all",
ansible/lib/,1156,containing `redhat-release` on top of their own.,
ansible/lib/,1159,This may occur when /etc is not readable but we can't be,
ansible/lib/,1160,sure about the *-release files. Check common entries of,
ansible/lib/,1161,/etc for information. If they turn out to not be there the,
ansible/lib/,1162,error is handled in `_parse_distro_release_file()`.,
ansible/lib/,1186,The name is always present if the pattern matches,

ansible/lib/,904,packages failed executing their post install scripts because of lack of,
ansible/lib/,905,free space (e.g. kernel package couldn't generate initramfs). Note that,
ansible/lib/,906,yum can still exit with rc=0 even if some post scripts didn't execute,
ansible/lib/,907,correctly.,
ansible/lib/,913,FIXME - if we did an install - go and check the rpmdb to see if it actually installed,
ansible/lib/,914,look for each pkg in rpmdb,
ansible/lib/,915,look for each pkg via obsoletes,
ansible/lib/,933,check if pkgspec is installed (if possible for idempotence),
ansible/lib/,938,Ensure the task fails in with-loop,
ansible/lib/,945,yum requires a local file to have the extension of .rpm and we,
ansible/lib/,946,"can not guarantee that from an URL (redirects, proxies, etc)",
ansible/lib/,953,most common case is the pkg is already installed,
ansible/lib/,965,case for two same envr but different archs like x86_64 and i686,
ansible/lib/,983,compare > 0 -> higher version is installed,
ansible/lib/,984,compare == 0 -> exact version is installed,
ansible/lib/,985,compare < 0 -> lower version is installed,
ansible/lib/,991,"else: if there are more installed packages with the same name, that would mean",
ansible/lib/,992,"kernel, gpg-pubkey or like, so just let yum deal with it and try to install it",
ansible/lib/,996,groups,
ansible/lib/,1003,range requires or file-requires or pkgname :(,
ansible/lib/,1005,most common case is the pkg is already installed and done,
ansible/lib/,1006,short circuit all the bs - and search for it as a pkg in is_installed,
ansible/lib/,1007,if you find it then we're done,
ansible/lib/,1014,look up what pkgs provide this,
ansible/lib/,1019,Ensure the task fails in with-loop,
ansible/lib/,1022,"if any of the packages are involved in a transaction, fail now",
ansible/lib/,1023,so that we don't hang on the yum operation later,
ansible/lib/,1027,Ensure the task fails in with-loop,
ansible/lib/,1030,if any of them are installed,
ansible/lib/,1031,then nothing to do,
ansible/lib/,1040,"if the version of the pkg you have installed is not in ANY repo, but there are",
ansible/lib/,1041,other versions in the repos (both higher and lower) then the previous checks won't work.,
ansible/lib/,1042,so we check one more time. This really only works for pkgname - not for file provides or virt provides,
ansible/lib/,1043,but virt provides should be all caught in what_provides on its own.,
ansible/lib/,1044,highly irritating,
ansible/lib/,1053,"Downgrade - The yum install command will only install or upgrade to a spec version, it will",
ansible/lib/,1054,not install an older version of an RPM even if specified by the install spec. So we need to,
ansible/lib/,1055,"determine if this is a downgrade, and then use the yum downgrade command to install the RPM.",
ansible/lib/,1058,Get the NEVRA of the requested package using pkglist instead of spec because pkglist,
ansible/lib/,1059,"contains consistently-formatted package names returned by yum, rather than user input",
ansible/lib/,1060,that is often not parsed correctly by splitFilename().,
ansible/lib/,1063,Check if any version of the requested package is installed,
ansible/lib/,1074,"If package needs to be installed/upgraded/downgraded, then pass in the spec",
ansible/lib/,1075,we could get here if nothing provides it but that's not,
ansible/lib/,1076,the error we're catching here,
ansible/lib/,1118,run an actual yum transaction,
ansible/lib/,1136,compile the results into one batch. If anything is changed,
ansible/lib/,1137,then mark changed,
ansible/lib/,1138,at the end - if we've end up failed then fail out of the rest,
ansible/lib/,1139,of the process,
ansible/lib/,1141,at this point we check to see if the pkg is no longer present,
ansible/lib/,1142,previous YumBase package index is now invalid,
ansible/lib/,1150,Return a message so it's obvious to the user why yum failed,
ansible/lib/,1151,and which package couldn't be removed. More details:,
ansible/lib/,1152,https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/35672,
ansible/lib/,1161,run check-update to see if we have packages pending,
ansible/lib/,1170,remove incorrect new lines in longer columns in output from yum check-update,
ansible/lib/,1171,yum line wrapping can move the repo to the next line,
ansible/lib/,1172,,
ansible/lib/,1173,Meant to filter out sets of lines like:,
ansible/lib/,1174,some_looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong_package_name   1:1.2.3-1.el7,
ansible/lib/,1175,some-repo-label,
ansible/lib/,1176,,
ansible/lib/,1177,But it also needs to avoid catching lines like:,

ansible/lib/,1182,preprocess string and filter out empty lines so the regex below works,
ansible/lib/,1187,build update dictionary,

ansible/lib/,1191,'*' in line matches lines like mirror lists:,
