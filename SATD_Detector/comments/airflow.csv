airflow/,20,Last Update: 8th April 2016,
airflow/,21,Caveat: This Dag will not run because of missing scripts.,
airflow/,22,The purpose of this is to give you a sample of a real world example DAG!,

airflow/,39,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,40,Create a few placeholder scripts. In practice these would be different python,
airflow/,41,"script files, which are imported in this section with absolute or relative imports",

airflow/,83,"'pool': 'backfill',",
airflow/,84,"'priority_weight': 10,",
airflow/,85,"'end_date': datetime(2016, 1, 1),",
airflow/,95,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,96,This task should call Twitter API and retrieve tweets from yesterday from and to,
airflow/,97,"for the four twitter users (Twitter_A,..,Twitter_D) There should be eight csv",
airflow/,98,output files generated by this task and naming convention,
airflow/,99,is direction(from or to)_twitterHandle_date.csv,
airflow/,100,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,107,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,108,Clean the eight files. In this step you can get rid of or cherry pick columns,
airflow/,109,and different parts of the text,
airflow/,110,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,119,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,120,In this section you can use a script to analyze the twitter data. Could simply,
airflow/,121,be a sentiment analysis through algorithms like bag of words or something more,
airflow/,122,complicated. You can also take a look at Web Services to do such tasks,
airflow/,123,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,132,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,133,"Although this is the last task, we need to declare it before the next tasks as we",
airflow/,134,will use set_downstream This task will extract summary from Hive data and store,
airflow/,135,it to MySQL,
airflow/,136,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,143,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,144,The following tasks are generated using for loop. The first task puts the eight,
airflow/,145,csv files to HDFS. The second task loads these files from HDFS to respected Hive,
airflow/,146,"tables. These two for loops could be combined into one loop. However, in most cases,",
airflow/,147,"you will be running different analysis on your incoming incoming and outgoing tweets,",
airflow/,148,and hence they are kept separated in this example.,
airflow/,149,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------,
airflow/,155,define where you want to store the tweets csv file in your local directory,
airflow/,157,define the location where you want to store in HDFS,

airflow/,164,try and convert the column to datetimes,
airflow/,165,the column MUST have a four digit year somewhere in the string,
airflow/,166,"there should be a better way to do this,",
airflow/,167,but just letting pandas try and convert every column without a format,
airflow/,168,caused it to convert floats as well,
airflow/,169,"For example, a column of integers",
airflow/,170,between 0 and 10 are turned into timestamps,
airflow/,171,"if the column cannot be converted,",
airflow/,172,just return the original column untouched,
airflow/,179,now convert the newly created datetimes into timestamps,
airflow/,180,we have to be careful here,
airflow/,181,because NaT cannot be converted to a timestamp,
airflow/,182,so we have to return NaN,
airflow/,239,this line right here will convert all integers to floats,
airflow/,240,if there are any None/np.nan values in the column,
airflow/,241,that's because None/np.nan cannot exist in an integer column,
airflow/,242,we should write all of our timestamps as FLOATS in our final schema,
airflow/,247,convert columns with datetime strings to datetimes,
airflow/,248,"not all strings will be datetimes, so we ignore any errors that occur",
airflow/,249,we get the object's definition at this point and only consider,
airflow/,250,features that are DATE or DATETIME,
airflow/,252,get the object name out of the query results,
airflow/,253,"it's stored in the ""attributes"" dictionary",
airflow/,254,for each returned record,
airflow/,261,possible columns that can be converted to timestamps,
airflow/,262,are the ones that are either date or datetime types,
airflow/,263,strings are too general and we risk unintentional conversion,
airflow/,275,write the CSV or JSON file depending on the option,
airflow/,276,NOTE:,
airflow/,277,datetimes here are an issue.,
airflow/,278,There is no good way to manage the difference,
airflow/,279,"for to_json, the options are an epoch or a ISO string",
airflow/,280,"but for to_csv, it will be a string output by datetime",
airflow/,281,For JSON we decided to output the epoch timestamp in seconds,
airflow/,282,(as is fairly standard for JavaScript),
airflow/,283,"And for csv, we do a string",
airflow/,285,there are also a ton of newline objects that mess up our ability to write to csv,
airflow/,286,we remove these newlines so that the output is a valid CSV format,
airflow/,292,write the dataframe,
