pipenv/,956,(... but it should be fixed in shlex...):,
pipenv/,962,"At this point, all shell-like parsing has been done (i.e.",
pipenv/,963,"comments processed, quotes and backslash escape sequences",

pipenv/,823,the actual metaclass.,
pipenv/,930,Complete the moves implementation.,
pipenv/,931,This code is at the end of this module to speed up module loading.,
pipenv/,932,Turn this module into a package.,

pipenv/,937,"Remove other six meta path importers, since they cause problems. This can",
pipenv/,938,happen if six is removed from sys.modules and then reloaded. (Setuptools does,
pipenv/,939,this for some reason.),
pipenv/,942,"Here's some real nastiness: Another ""instance"" of the six module might",
pipenv/,943,"be floating around. Therefore, we can't use isinstance() to check for",
pipenv/,944,"the six meta path importer, since the other six instance will have",
pipenv/,945,inserted an importer with different class.,
pipenv/,951,"Finally, add the importer to the meta path import hook.",
pipenv/,14,Downstream redistributors which have debundled our dependencies should also,
pipenv/,15,patch this value to be true. This will trigger the additional patching,

pipenv/,20,add to the beginning of sys.path before attempting to import anything. This,
pipenv/,21,is done to support downstream re-distributors like Debian and Fedora who,
pipenv/,22,wish to create their own Wheels for our dependencies to aid in debundling.,
pipenv/,26,Define a small helper function to alias our vendored modules to the real ones,
pipenv/,27,if the vendored ones do not exist. This idea of this was taken from,
pipenv/,28,https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/pull/2567.,
pipenv/,35,We can just silently allow import failures to pass here. If we,
pipenv/,36,got to this point it means that ``import pipenv.patched.notpip._vendor.whatever``,
pipenv/,37,failed and so did ``import whatever``. Since we're importing this,
pipenv/,38,"upfront in an attempt to alias imports, not erroring here will",
pipenv/,39,just mean we get a regular import error whenever pip *actually*,
pipenv/,40,"tries to import one of these modules to use it, which actually",
pipenv/,41,gives us a better error message than we would have otherwise,
pipenv/,42,gotten.,

pipenv/,51,the aliasing of our vendored libraries as well as looking for wheels to add,
pipenv/,52,to our sys.path. This will cause all of this code to be a no-op typically,
pipenv/,53,however downstream redistributors can enable it in a consistent way across,
pipenv/,54,all platforms.,

pipenv/,31,This prober doesn't actually recognize a language or a charset.,
pipenv/,32,It is a helper prober for the use of the Hebrew model probers,
pipenv/,34,General ideas of the Hebrew charset recognition,
pipenv/,35,,
pipenv/,36,Four main charsets exist in Hebrew:,
pipenv/,37,"""ISO-8859-8"" - Visual Hebrew",
pipenv/,38,"""windows-1255"" - Logical Hebrew",
pipenv/,39,"""ISO-8859-8-I"" - Logical Hebrew",
pipenv/,40,"""x-mac-hebrew"" - ?? Logical Hebrew ??",
pipenv/,41,,
pipenv/,42,"Both ""ISO"" charsets use a completely identical set of code points, whereas",
pipenv/,43,"""windows-1255"" and ""x-mac-hebrew"" are two different proper supersets of",
pipenv/,44,these code points. windows-1255 defines additional characters in the range,
pipenv/,45,0x80-0x9F as some misc punctuation marks as well as some Hebrew-specific,
pipenv/,46,diacritics and additional 'Yiddish' ligature letters in the range 0xc0-0xd6.,
pipenv/,47,x-mac-hebrew defines similar additional code points but with a different,
pipenv/,48,mapping.,
pipenv/,49,,
pipenv/,50,"As far as an average Hebrew text with no diacritics is concerned, all four",
pipenv/,51,charsets are identical with respect to code points. Meaning that for the,
pipenv/,52,"main Hebrew alphabet, all four map the same values to all 27 Hebrew letters",
pipenv/,53,(including final letters).,
pipenv/,54,,
pipenv/,55,The dominant difference between these charsets is their directionality.,
pipenv/,56,"""Visual"" directionality means that the text is ordered as if the renderer is",
pipenv/,57,not aware of a BIDI rendering algorithm. The renderer sees the text and,
pipenv/,58,draws it from left to right. The text itself when ordered naturally is read,
pipenv/,59,backwards. A buffer of Visual Hebrew generally looks like so:,
pipenv/,60,"""[last word of first line spelled backwards] [whole line ordered backwards",
pipenv/,61,and spelled backwards] [first word of first line spelled backwards],
pipenv/,62,"[end of line] [last word of second line] ... etc' """,
pipenv/,63,"adding punctuation marks, numbers and English text to visual text is",
pipenv/,64,"naturally also ""visual"" and from left to right.",
pipenv/,65,,
pipenv/,66,"""Logical"" directionality means the text is ordered ""naturally"" according to",
pipenv/,67,the order it is read. It is the responsibility of the renderer to display,
pipenv/,68,the text from right to left. A BIDI algorithm is used to place general,
pipenv/,69,"punctuation marks, numbers and English text in the text.",
pipenv/,70,,
pipenv/,71,Texts in x-mac-hebrew are almost impossible to find on the Internet. From,
pipenv/,72,"what little evidence I could find, it seems that its general directionality",
pipenv/,73,is Logical.,
pipenv/,74,,
pipenv/,75,"To sum up all of the above, the Hebrew probing mechanism knows about two",
pipenv/,76,charsets:,
pipenv/,77,"Visual Hebrew - ""ISO-8859-8"" - backwards text - Words and sentences are",
pipenv/,78,backwards while line order is natural. For charset recognition purposes,
pipenv/,79,"the line order is unimportant (In fact, for this implementation, even",
pipenv/,80,word order is unimportant).,
pipenv/,81,"Logical Hebrew - ""windows-1255"" - normal, naturally ordered text.",
pipenv/,82,,
pipenv/,83,"""ISO-8859-8-I"" is a subset of windows-1255 and doesn't need to be",
pipenv/,84,specifically identified.,
pipenv/,85,"""x-mac-hebrew"" is also identified as windows-1255. A text in x-mac-hebrew",
pipenv/,86,that contain special punctuation marks or diacritics is displayed with,
pipenv/,87,some unconverted characters showing as question marks. This problem might,
pipenv/,88,be corrected using another model prober for x-mac-hebrew. Due to the fact,
pipenv/,89,"that x-mac-hebrew texts are so rare, writing another model prober isn't",
pipenv/,90,worth the effort and performance hit.,
pipenv/,91,,
pipenv/,92,The Prober,
pipenv/,93,,
pipenv/,94,"The prober is divided between two SBCharSetProbers and a HebrewProber,",
pipenv/,95,"all of which are managed, created, fed data, inquired and deleted by the",
pipenv/,96,SBCSGroupProber. The two SBCharSetProbers identify that the text is in,
pipenv/,97,"fact some kind of Hebrew, Logical or Visual. The final decision about which",
pipenv/,98,one is it is made by the HebrewProber by combining final-letter scores,
pipenv/,99,with the scores of the two SBCharSetProbers to produce a final answer.,
pipenv/,100,,
pipenv/,101,The SBCSGroupProber is responsible for stripping the original text of HTML,
pipenv/,102,"tags, English characters, numbers, low-ASCII punctuation characters, spaces",
pipenv/,103,and new lines. It reduces any sequence of such characters to a single space.,
pipenv/,104,The buffer fed to each prober in the SBCS group prober is pure text in,
pipenv/,105,high-ASCII.,
pipenv/,106,The two SBCharSetProbers (model probers) share the same language model:,
pipenv/,107,Win1255Model.,
pipenv/,108,The first SBCharSetProber uses the model normally as any other,
pipenv/,109,"SBCharSetProber does, to recognize windows-1255, upon which this model was",
pipenv/,110,built. The second SBCharSetProber is told to make the pair-of-letter,
pipenv/,111,lookup in the language model backwards. This in practice exactly simulates,
pipenv/,112,a visual Hebrew model using the windows-1255 logical Hebrew model.,
pipenv/,113,,
pipenv/,114,The HebrewProber is not using any language model. All it does is look for,
pipenv/,115,final-letter evidence suggesting the text is either logical Hebrew or visual,
pipenv/,116,"Hebrew. Disjointed from the model probers, the results of the HebrewProber",
pipenv/,117,alone are meaningless. HebrewProber always returns 0.00 as confidence,
pipenv/,118,"since it never identifies a charset by itself. Instead, the pointer to the",
pipenv/,119,"HebrewProber is passed to the model probers as a helper ""Name Prober"".",
pipenv/,120,"When the Group prober receives a positive identification from any prober,",
pipenv/,121,it asks for the name of the charset identified. If the prober queried is a,
pipenv/,122,"Hebrew model prober, the model prober forwards the call to the",
pipenv/,123,"HebrewProber to make the final decision. In the HebrewProber, the",
pipenv/,124,decision is made according to the final-letters scores maintained and Both,
pipenv/,125,model probers scores. The answer is returned in the form of the name of the,
pipenv/,126,"charset identified, either ""windows-1255"" or ""ISO-8859-8"".",
pipenv/,129,windows-1255 / ISO-8859-8 code points of interest,
pipenv/,141,Minimum Visual vs Logical final letter score difference.,
pipenv/,142,"If the difference is below this, don't rely solely on the final letter score",
pipenv/,143,distance.,
pipenv/,146,Minimum Visual vs Logical model score difference.,
pipenv/,147,"If the difference is below this, don't rely at all on the model score",
pipenv/,148,distance.,
pipenv/,167,"The two last characters seen in the previous buffer,",
pipenv/,168,mPrev and mBeforePrev are initialized to space in order to simulate,
pipenv/,169,a word delimiter at the beginning of the data,
pipenv/,172,These probers are owned by the group prober.,
pipenv/,183,The normal Tsadi is not a good Non-Final letter due to words like,
pipenv/,184,'lechotet' (to chat) containing an apostrophe after the tsadi. This,
pipenv/,185,apostrophe is converted to a space in FilterWithoutEnglishLetters,
pipenv/,186,causing the Non-Final tsadi to appear at an end of a word even,
pipenv/,187,though this is not the case in the original text.,
pipenv/,188,The letters Pe and Kaf rarely display a related behavior of not being,
pipenv/,189,"a good Non-Final letter. Words like 'Pop', 'Winamp' and 'Mubarak'",
pipenv/,190,"for example legally end with a Non-Final Pe or Kaf. However, the",
pipenv/,191,benefit of these letters as Non-Final letters outweighs the damage,
pipenv/,192,since these words are quite rare.,
pipenv/,197,Final letter analysis for logical-visual decision.,
pipenv/,198,Look for evidence that the received buffer is either logical Hebrew,
pipenv/,199,or visual Hebrew.,
pipenv/,200,The following cases are checked:,
pipenv/,201,"1) A word longer than 1 letter, ending with a final letter. This is",
pipenv/,202,"an indication that the text is laid out ""naturally"" since the",
pipenv/,203,final letter really appears at the end. +1 for logical score.,
pipenv/,204,"2) A word longer than 1 letter, ending with a Non-Final letter. In",
pipenv/,205,"normal Hebrew, words ending with Kaf, Mem, Nun, Pe or Tsadi,",
pipenv/,206,should not end with the Non-Final form of that letter. Exceptions,
pipenv/,207,to this rule are mentioned above in isNonFinal(). This is an,
pipenv/,208,indication that the text is laid out backwards. +1 for visual,
pipenv/,209,score,
pipenv/,210,"3) A word longer than 1 letter, starting with a final letter. Final",
pipenv/,211,letters should not appear at the beginning of a word. This is an,
pipenv/,212,indication that the text is laid out backwards. +1 for visual,
pipenv/,213,score.,
pipenv/,214,,
pipenv/,215,The visual score and logical score are accumulated throughout the,
pipenv/,216,text and are finally checked against each other in GetCharSetName().,
pipenv/,217,No checking for final letters in the middle of words is done since,
pipenv/,218,that case is not an indication for either Logical or Visual text.,
pipenv/,219,,
pipenv/,220,We automatically filter out all 7-bit characters (replace them with,
pipenv/,221,spaces) so the word boundary detection works properly. [MAP],
pipenv/,224,Both model probers say it's not them. No reason to continue.,
pipenv/,231,We stand on a space - a word just ended,
pipenv/,233,next-to-last char was not a space so self._prev is not a,
pipenv/,234,1 letter word,
pipenv/,236,case (1) [-2:not space][-1:final letter][cur:space],
pipenv/,239,case (2) [-2:not space][-1:Non-Final letter][,
pipenv/,240,cur:space],
pipenv/,243,Not standing on a space,
pipenv/,246,case (3) [-2:space][-1:final letter][cur:not space],
pipenv/,251,"Forever detecting, till the end or until both model probers return",
pipenv/,252,ProbingState.NOT_ME (handled above),
pipenv/,257,Make the decision: is it Logical or Visual?,
pipenv/,258,"If the final letter score distance is dominant enough, rely on it.",
pipenv/,265,"It's not dominant enough, try to rely on the model scores instead.",
pipenv/,273,"Still no good, back to final letter distance, maybe it'll save the",
pipenv/,274,day.,
pipenv/,278,(finalsub > 0 - Logical) or (don't know what to do) default to,
pipenv/,279,Logical.,
pipenv/,288,Remain active as long as any of the model probers are active.,

pipenv/,92,,
pipenv/,93,"We need to lock around this structure for inserts, but we don't do it for",

pipenv/,95,,
pipenv/,96,1. It is not possible to call into the callbacks before the dictionary is,

pipenv/,98,"2. The callbacks don't mutate the dictionary, they only read from it, and",

pipenv/,110,"This is our equivalent of util.ssl_.DEFAULT_CIPHERS, but expanded out to",

pipenv/,289,"This has some needless copying here, but I'm not sure there's",
pipenv/,290,much value in optimising this data path.,
pipenv/,313,We need to keep these two objects references alive: if they get GC'd while,
pipenv/,314,in use then SecureTransport could attempt to call a function that is in freed,
pipenv/,315,"memory. That would be...uh...bad. Yeah, that's the word. Bad.",
pipenv/,338,We save off the previously-configured timeout and then set it to,
pipenv/,339,zero. This is done because we use select and friends to handle the,
pipenv/,340,"timeouts, but if we leave the timeout set on the lower socket then",
pipenv/,341,"Python will ""kindly"" call select on that socket again for us. Avoid",
pipenv/,342,that by forcing the timeout to zero.,
pipenv/,358,We explicitly don't catch around this yield because in the unlikely,
pipenv/,359,event that an exception was hit in the block we don't want to swallow,
pipenv/,360,it.,
pipenv/,386,"If we disabled cert validation, just say: cool.",
pipenv/,390,"We want data in memory, so load it up.",
pipenv/,399,Get a CFArray that contains the certs we want.,

pipenv/,404,"ignore everything else it knows, and then ask if it can build a",
pipenv/,405,chain. This is a buuuunch of code.,
pipenv/,427,"Ok, now we can look at what the result was.",
pipenv/,452,"First, we do the initial bits of connection setup. We need to create",
pipenv/,453,"a context, set its I/O funcs, and set the connection reference.",
pipenv/,462,Here we need to compute the handle to use. We do this by taking the,
pipenv/,463,"id of self modulo 2**31 - 1. If this is already in the dictionary, we",

pipenv/,502,"If there's a trust DB, we need to use it. We do that by telling",

pipenv/,627,TODO: should I do clean shutdown here? Do I have to?,
pipenv/,646,"Urgh, annoying.",
pipenv/,647,,
pipenv/,648,Here's how we do this:,
pipenv/,649,,
pipenv/,650,1. Call SSLCopyPeerTrust to get hold of the trust object for this,
pipenv/,651,connection.,
pipenv/,652,2. Call SecTrustGetCertificateAtIndex for index 0 to get the leaf.,
pipenv/,653,"3. To get the CN, call SecCertificateCopyCommonName and process that",
pipenv/,654,string so that it's of the appropriate type.,
pipenv/,655,"4. To get the SAN, we need to do something a bit more complex:",
pipenv/,656,"a. Call SecCertificateCopyValues to get the data, requesting",
pipenv/,657,kSecOIDSubjectAltName.,
pipenv/,658,b. Mess about with this dictionary to try to get the SANs out.,
pipenv/,659,,
pipenv/,660,This is gross. Really gross. It's going to be a few hundred LoC extra,
pipenv/,661,just to repeat something that SecureTransport can *already do*. So my,
pipenv/,662,operating assumption at this time is that what we want to do is,
pipenv/,663,instead to just flag to urllib3 that it shouldn't do its own hostname,
pipenv/,664,validation when using SecureTransport.,
pipenv/,672,Grab the trust store.,
pipenv/,676,Probably we haven't done the handshake yet. No biggie.,
pipenv/,681,Also a case that might happen if we haven't handshaked.,
pipenv/,682,Handshook? Handshaken?,
pipenv/,688,"Ok, now we want the DER bytes.",
pipenv/,734,Platform-specific: Python 2,
pipenv/,741,Platform-specific: Python 3,
pipenv/,744,We disable buffering with SecureTransport because it conflicts with,
pipenv/,745,the buffering that ST does internally (see issue #1153 for more).,
pipenv/,787,"TODO: Well, crap.",
pipenv/,788,,
pipenv/,789,So this is the bit of the code that is the most likely to cause us,
pipenv/,790,trouble. Essentially we need to enumerate all of the SSL options that,
pipenv/,791,users might want to use and try to see if we can sensibly translate,
pipenv/,792,"them, or whether we should just ignore them.",
pipenv/,797,TODO: Update in line with above.,
pipenv/,809,"So, this has to do something a bit weird. Specifically, what it does",
pipenv/,810,is nothing.,
pipenv/,811,,
pipenv/,812,"This means that, if we had previously had load_verify_locations",
pipenv/,813,"called, this does not undo that. We need to do that because it turns",
pipenv/,814,out that the rest of the urllib3 code will attempt to load the,
pipenv/,815,"default verify paths if it hasn't been told about any paths, even if",
pipenv/,816,the context itself was sometime earlier. We resolve that by just,
pipenv/,817,ignoring it.,
pipenv/,824,"For now, we just require the default cipher string.",
pipenv/,829,"OK, we only really support cadata and cafile.",
pipenv/,848,"So, what do we do here? Firstly, we assert some properties. This is a",
pipenv/,849,"stripped down shim, so there is some functionality we don't support.",
pipenv/,850,See PEP 543 for the real deal.,
pipenv/,855,"Ok, we're good to go. Now we want to create the wrapped socket object",
pipenv/,856,and store it in the appropriate place.,
pipenv/,859,Now we can handshake,
pipenv/,21,This regular expression is used to grab PEM data out of a PEM bundle.,
pipenv/,43,We need to get the dictionary keys and values out in the same order.,
pipenv/,110,Normalize the PEM bundle's line endings.,
pipenv/,142,We need to free the array before the exception bubbles further.,
pipenv/,143,"We only want to do that if an error occurs: otherwise, the caller",
pipenv/,144,should free.,
pipenv/,177,"Unfortunately, SecKeychainCreate requires a path to a keychain. This",
pipenv/,178,"means we cannot use mkstemp to use a generic temporary file. Instead,",
pipenv/,179,we're going to create a temporary directory and a filename to use there.,
pipenv/,180,This filename will be 8 random bytes expanded into base64. We also need,
pipenv/,181,"some random bytes to password-protect the keychain we're creating, so we",
pipenv/,182,ask for 40 random bytes.,
pipenv/,185,Must be valid UTF-8,
pipenv/,190,We now want to create the keychain itself.,

pipenv/,227,The keychain to insert into,

pipenv/,232,A CFArray is not very useful to us as an intermediary,
pipenv/,233,"representation, so we are going to extract the objects we want",
pipenv/,234,and then free the array. We don't need to keep hold of keys: the,
pipenv/,235,keychain already has them!,
pipenv/,263,"Ok, the strategy.",
pipenv/,264,,
pipenv/,265,This relies on knowing that macOS will not give you a SecIdentityRef,
pipenv/,266,unless you have imported a key into a keychain. This is a somewhat,
pipenv/,267,"artificial limitation of macOS (for example, it doesn't necessarily",
pipenv/,268,"affect iOS), but there is nothing inside Security.framework that lets you",
pipenv/,269,get a SecIdentityRef without having a key in a keychain.,
pipenv/,270,,
pipenv/,271,So the policy here is we take all the files and iterate them in order.,
pipenv/,272,Each one will use SecItemImport to have one or more objects loaded from,
pipenv/,273,it. We will also point at a keychain that macOS can use to work with the,
pipenv/,274,private key.,
pipenv/,275,,
pipenv/,276,"Once we have all the objects, we'll check what we actually have. If we",
pipenv/,277,"already have a SecIdentityRef in hand, fab: we'll use that. Otherwise,",
pipenv/,278,we'll take the first certificate (which we assume to be our leaf) and,
pipenv/,279,ask the keychain to give us a SecIdentityRef with that cert's associated,
pipenv/,280,key.,
pipenv/,281,,
pipenv/,282,We'll then return a CFArray containing the trust chain: one,
pipenv/,283,SecIdentityRef and then zero-or-more SecCertificateRef objects. The,
pipenv/,284,responsibility for freeing this CFArray will be with the caller. This,
pipenv/,285,"CFArray must remain alive for the entire connection, so in practice it",
pipenv/,286,"will be stored with a single SSLSocket, along with the reference to the",
pipenv/,287,keychain.,
pipenv/,291,Filter out bad paths.,
pipenv/,300,"Ok, we have everything. The question is: do we have an identity? If",
pipenv/,301,"not, we want to grab one from the first cert we have.",
pipenv/,310,"We now want to release the original certificate, as we no longer",
pipenv/,311,need it.,
pipenv/,314,We now need to build a new CFArray that holds the trust chain.,
pipenv/,321,"ArrayAppendValue does a CFRetain on the item. That's fine,",
pipenv/,322,because the finally block will release our other refs to them.,

pipenv/,18,How should we wait on sockets?,

pipenv/,20,There are two types of APIs you can use for waiting on sockets: the fancy,
pipenv/,21,"modern stateful APIs like epoll/kqueue, and the older stateless APIs like",
pipenv/,22,select/poll. The stateful APIs are more efficient when you have a lots of,
pipenv/,23,"sockets to keep track of, because you can set them up once and then use them",
pipenv/,24,lots of times. But we only ever want to wait on a single socket at a time,
pipenv/,25,"and don't want to keep track of state, so the stateless APIs are actually",
pipenv/,26,more efficient. So we want to use select() or poll().,
pipenv/,27,,
pipenv/,28,"Now, how do we choose between select() and poll()? On traditional Unixes,",
pipenv/,29,"select() has a strange calling convention that makes it slow, or fail",
pipenv/,30,"altogether, for high-numbered file descriptors. The point of poll() is to fix",
pipenv/,31,"that, so on Unixes, we prefer poll().",
pipenv/,32,,
pipenv/,33,"On Windows, there is no poll() (or at least Python doesn't provide a wrapper",
pipenv/,34,"for it), but that's OK, because on Windows, select() doesn't have this",
pipenv/,35,strange calling convention; plain select() works fine.,
pipenv/,36,,
pipenv/,37,"So: on Windows we use select(), and everywhere else we use poll(). We also",
pipenv/,38,fall back to select() in case poll() is somehow broken or missing.,
pipenv/,41,"Modern Python, that retries syscalls by default",
pipenv/,47,Old and broken Pythons.,
pipenv/,57,"OSError for 3 <= pyver < 3.5, select.error for pyver <= 2.7",
pipenv/,59,'e.args[0]' incantation works for both OSError and select.error,

pipenv/,84,thing.),
pipenv/,101,"For some reason, poll() takes timeout in milliseconds",
pipenv/,115,Apparently some systems have a select.poll that fails as soon as you try,

pipenv/,1702,--------------------------------------------------------------------------,
pipenv/,1703,Below are the classmethods which act as alternate constructors to the,
pipenv/,1704,TarFile class. The open() method is the only one that is needed for,
pipenv/,1705,"public use; it is the ""super""-constructor and is able to select an",
pipenv/,1706,"adequate ""sub""-constructor for a particular compression using the mapping",
pipenv/,1707,from OPEN_METH.,
pipenv/,1708,,
pipenv/,1709,This concept allows one to subclass TarFile without losing the comfort of,
pipenv/,1710,the super-constructor. A sub-constructor is registered and made available,
pipenv/,1711,by adding it to the mapping in OPEN_METH.,
pipenv/,1741,Find out which *open() is appropriate for opening the file.,
pipenv/,1759,Select the *open() function according to,

pipenv/,1862,The public methods which TarFile provides:,
pipenv/,1874,fill up the end with zero-blocks,
pipenv/,1875,(like option -b20 for tar does),
pipenv/,1900,if we want to obtain a list of,
pipenv/,1901,"all members, we first have to",
pipenv/,1902,scan the whole archive.,
pipenv/,1920,"When fileobj is given, replace name by",

pipenv/,1926,"Backward slashes are converted to forward slashes,",
pipenv/,1927,Absolute paths are turned to relative paths.,
pipenv/,1934,"Now, fill the TarInfo object with",
pipenv/,1935,information specific for the file.,
pipenv/,1939,"Use os.stat or os.lstat, depending on platform",
pipenv/,1940,and if symlinks shall be resolved.,
pipenv/,1955,Is it a hardlink to an already,
pipenv/,1956,archived file?,
pipenv/,1960,The inode is added only if its valid.,
pipenv/,1961,For win32 it is always 0.,
pipenv/,1979,Fill the TarInfo object with all,
pipenv/,1980,information we can get.,
pipenv/,2054,Exclude pathnames.,
pipenv/,2063,Skip if somebody tries to archive the archive...,
pipenv/,2070,Create a TarInfo object from the file.,
pipenv/,2077,Change or exclude the TarInfo object.,
pipenv/,2084,Append the tar header and data to the archive.,
pipenv/,2115,"If there's data to follow, append it.",
pipenv/,2140,Extract directories with a safe mode.,
pipenv/,2144,"Do not set_attrs directories, as we will do that further down",
pipenv/,2147,Reverse sort directories.,
pipenv/,2151,"Set correct owner, mtime and filemode on directories.",
pipenv/,2178,Prepare the link target for makelink().,
pipenv/,2219,"If a member's type is unknown, it is treated as a",
pipenv/,2220,regular file.,
pipenv/,2225,A small but ugly workaround for the case that someone tries,
pipenv/,2226,to extract a (sym)link as a file-object from a non-seekable,
pipenv/,2227,stream of tar blocks.,
pipenv/,2230,A (sym)link's file object is its target's file object.,
pipenv/,2233,"If there's no data associated with the member (directory, chrdev,",
pipenv/,2234,"blkdev, etc.), return None instead of a file object.",
pipenv/,2241,Fetch the TarInfo object for the given name,
pipenv/,2242,"and build the destination pathname, replacing",
pipenv/,2243,forward slashes to platform specific separators.,
pipenv/,2247,Create all upper directories.,
pipenv/,2250,Create directories that are not part of the archive with,
pipenv/,2251,default permissions.,
pipenv/,2280,--------------------------------------------------------------------------,
pipenv/,2281,Below are the different file methods. They are called via,
pipenv/,2282,_extract_member() when extract() is called. They can be replaced in a,
pipenv/,2283,subclass to implement other functionality.,
pipenv/,2289,"Use a safe mode for the directory, the real mode is set",
pipenv/,2290,later in _extract_member().,
pipenv/,2349,For systems that support symbolic and hard links.,
pipenv/,2353,See extract().,
pipenv/,2376,We have to be root to do so.,
pipenv/,2413,--------------------------------------------------------------------------,

pipenv/,2461,Little helper methods:,
pipenv/,2467,Ensure that all members have been loaded.,
pipenv/,2470,Limit the member search list up to tarinfo.,
pipenv/,2510,Always search the entire archive.,
pipenv/,2514,"Search the archive before the link, because a hard link is",
pipenv/,2515,just a reference to an already archived file.,
pipenv/,2546,An exception occurred. We must not call close() because,
pipenv/,2547,it would try to write end-of-archive blocks and padding.,
pipenv/,2551,class TarFile,
pipenv/,2574,Fix for SF #1100429: Under rare circumstances it can,
pipenv/,2575,"happen that getmembers() is called during iteration,",
pipenv/,2576,which will cause TarIter to stop prematurely.,

pipenv/,490,Irix takes a long time before it realizes a child was terminated.,

pipenv/,492,FIXME So does this mean Irix systems are forced to always have,
pipenv/,493,FIXME a 2 second delay when calling read_nonblocking? That sucks.,
pipenv/,497,"Because of the select(0) check above, we know that no data",
pipenv/,498,is available right now. But if a non-zero timeout is given,

pipenv/,31,This prober doesn't actually recognize a language or a charset.,
pipenv/,32,It is a helper prober for the use of the Hebrew model probers,
pipenv/,34,General ideas of the Hebrew charset recognition,
pipenv/,35,,
pipenv/,36,Four main charsets exist in Hebrew:,
pipenv/,37,"""ISO-8859-8"" - Visual Hebrew",
pipenv/,38,"""windows-1255"" - Logical Hebrew",
pipenv/,39,"""ISO-8859-8-I"" - Logical Hebrew",
pipenv/,40,"""x-mac-hebrew"" - ?? Logical Hebrew ??",
pipenv/,41,,
pipenv/,42,"Both ""ISO"" charsets use a completely identical set of code points, whereas",
pipenv/,43,"""windows-1255"" and ""x-mac-hebrew"" are two different proper supersets of",
pipenv/,44,these code points. windows-1255 defines additional characters in the range,
pipenv/,45,0x80-0x9F as some misc punctuation marks as well as some Hebrew-specific,
pipenv/,46,diacritics and additional 'Yiddish' ligature letters in the range 0xc0-0xd6.,
pipenv/,47,x-mac-hebrew defines similar additional code points but with a different,
pipenv/,48,mapping.,
pipenv/,49,,
pipenv/,50,"As far as an average Hebrew text with no diacritics is concerned, all four",
pipenv/,51,charsets are identical with respect to code points. Meaning that for the,
pipenv/,52,"main Hebrew alphabet, all four map the same values to all 27 Hebrew letters",
pipenv/,53,(including final letters).,
pipenv/,54,,
pipenv/,55,The dominant difference between these charsets is their directionality.,
pipenv/,56,"""Visual"" directionality means that the text is ordered as if the renderer is",
pipenv/,57,not aware of a BIDI rendering algorithm. The renderer sees the text and,
pipenv/,58,draws it from left to right. The text itself when ordered naturally is read,
pipenv/,59,backwards. A buffer of Visual Hebrew generally looks like so:,
pipenv/,60,"""[last word of first line spelled backwards] [whole line ordered backwards",
pipenv/,61,and spelled backwards] [first word of first line spelled backwards],
pipenv/,62,"[end of line] [last word of second line] ... etc' """,
pipenv/,63,"adding punctuation marks, numbers and English text to visual text is",
pipenv/,64,"naturally also ""visual"" and from left to right.",
pipenv/,65,,
pipenv/,66,"""Logical"" directionality means the text is ordered ""naturally"" according to",
pipenv/,67,the order it is read. It is the responsibility of the renderer to display,
pipenv/,68,the text from right to left. A BIDI algorithm is used to place general,
pipenv/,69,"punctuation marks, numbers and English text in the text.",
pipenv/,70,,
pipenv/,71,Texts in x-mac-hebrew are almost impossible to find on the Internet. From,
pipenv/,72,"what little evidence I could find, it seems that its general directionality",
pipenv/,73,is Logical.,
pipenv/,74,,
pipenv/,75,"To sum up all of the above, the Hebrew probing mechanism knows about two",
pipenv/,76,charsets:,
pipenv/,77,"Visual Hebrew - ""ISO-8859-8"" - backwards text - Words and sentences are",
pipenv/,78,backwards while line order is natural. For charset recognition purposes,
pipenv/,79,"the line order is unimportant (In fact, for this implementation, even",
pipenv/,80,word order is unimportant).,
pipenv/,81,"Logical Hebrew - ""windows-1255"" - normal, naturally ordered text.",
pipenv/,82,,
pipenv/,83,"""ISO-8859-8-I"" is a subset of windows-1255 and doesn't need to be",
pipenv/,84,specifically identified.,
pipenv/,85,"""x-mac-hebrew"" is also identified as windows-1255. A text in x-mac-hebrew",
pipenv/,86,that contain special punctuation marks or diacritics is displayed with,
pipenv/,87,some unconverted characters showing as question marks. This problem might,
pipenv/,88,be corrected using another model prober for x-mac-hebrew. Due to the fact,
pipenv/,89,"that x-mac-hebrew texts are so rare, writing another model prober isn't",
pipenv/,90,worth the effort and performance hit.,
pipenv/,91,,
pipenv/,92,The Prober,
pipenv/,93,,
pipenv/,94,"The prober is divided between two SBCharSetProbers and a HebrewProber,",
pipenv/,95,"all of which are managed, created, fed data, inquired and deleted by the",
pipenv/,96,SBCSGroupProber. The two SBCharSetProbers identify that the text is in,
pipenv/,97,"fact some kind of Hebrew, Logical or Visual. The final decision about which",
pipenv/,98,one is it is made by the HebrewProber by combining final-letter scores,
pipenv/,99,with the scores of the two SBCharSetProbers to produce a final answer.,
pipenv/,100,,
pipenv/,101,The SBCSGroupProber is responsible for stripping the original text of HTML,
pipenv/,102,"tags, English characters, numbers, low-ASCII punctuation characters, spaces",
pipenv/,103,and new lines. It reduces any sequence of such characters to a single space.,
pipenv/,104,The buffer fed to each prober in the SBCS group prober is pure text in,
pipenv/,105,high-ASCII.,
pipenv/,106,The two SBCharSetProbers (model probers) share the same language model:,
pipenv/,107,Win1255Model.,
pipenv/,108,The first SBCharSetProber uses the model normally as any other,
pipenv/,109,"SBCharSetProber does, to recognize windows-1255, upon which this model was",
pipenv/,110,built. The second SBCharSetProber is told to make the pair-of-letter,
pipenv/,111,lookup in the language model backwards. This in practice exactly simulates,
pipenv/,112,a visual Hebrew model using the windows-1255 logical Hebrew model.,
pipenv/,113,,
pipenv/,114,The HebrewProber is not using any language model. All it does is look for,
pipenv/,115,final-letter evidence suggesting the text is either logical Hebrew or visual,
pipenv/,116,"Hebrew. Disjointed from the model probers, the results of the HebrewProber",
pipenv/,117,alone are meaningless. HebrewProber always returns 0.00 as confidence,
pipenv/,118,"since it never identifies a charset by itself. Instead, the pointer to the",
pipenv/,119,"HebrewProber is passed to the model probers as a helper ""Name Prober"".",
pipenv/,120,"When the Group prober receives a positive identification from any prober,",
pipenv/,121,it asks for the name of the charset identified. If the prober queried is a,
pipenv/,122,"Hebrew model prober, the model prober forwards the call to the",
pipenv/,123,"HebrewProber to make the final decision. In the HebrewProber, the",
pipenv/,124,decision is made according to the final-letters scores maintained and Both,
pipenv/,125,model probers scores. The answer is returned in the form of the name of the,
pipenv/,126,"charset identified, either ""windows-1255"" or ""ISO-8859-8"".",
pipenv/,129,windows-1255 / ISO-8859-8 code points of interest,
pipenv/,141,Minimum Visual vs Logical final letter score difference.,
pipenv/,142,"If the difference is below this, don't rely solely on the final letter score",
pipenv/,143,distance.,
pipenv/,146,Minimum Visual vs Logical model score difference.,
pipenv/,147,"If the difference is below this, don't rely at all on the model score",
pipenv/,148,distance.,
pipenv/,167,"The two last characters seen in the previous buffer,",
pipenv/,168,mPrev and mBeforePrev are initialized to space in order to simulate,
pipenv/,169,a word delimiter at the beginning of the data,
pipenv/,172,These probers are owned by the group prober.,
pipenv/,183,The normal Tsadi is not a good Non-Final letter due to words like,

pipenv/,205,"normal Hebrew, words ending with Kaf, Mem, Nun, Pe or Tsadi,",
pipenv/,206,should not end with the Non-Final form of that letter. Exceptions,
pipenv/,207,to this rule are mentioned above in isNonFinal(). This is an,
pipenv/,208,indication that the text is laid out backwards. +1 for visual,
pipenv/,209,score,
pipenv/,210,"3) A word longer than 1 letter, starting with a final letter. Final",
pipenv/,211,letters should not appear at the beginning of a word. This is an,
pipenv/,212,indication that the text is laid out backwards. +1 for visual,
pipenv/,213,score.,

pipenv/,3,provided a lot of what went into the implementation here in,
pipenv/,4,the discussion to issue1602 in the Python bug tracker.,
pipenv/,5,,
pipenv/,6,There are some general differences in regards to how this works,
pipenv/,7,compared to the original patches as we do not need to patch,
pipenv/,8,the entire interpreter but just work in our little world of,

pipenv/,185,fetched for that.  This obviously is not the most correct way to do,
pipenv/,186,"it as it changes global state.  Unfortunately, there does not seem to",
pipenv/,187,be a clear better way to do it as just reopening the file in binary,
pipenv/,188,mode does not change anything.,
pipenv/,189,,
pipenv/,190,An option would be to do what Python 3 does and to open the file as,
pipenv/,191,"binary only, patch it back to the system, and then use a wrapper",
pipenv/,192,stream that converts newlines.  It's not quite clear what's the,
pipenv/,193,correct option here.,
pipenv/,194,,
pipenv/,195,This code also lives in _winconsole for the fallback to the console,

pipenv/,548,Atomic writes are more complicated.  They work by opening a file,

pipenv/,405,to long match the option first.,
pipenv/,412,At this point we will match the (assumed) long option through,

pipenv/,420,"which says, that if we have a two character options prefix",

pipenv/,96,1. It is not possible to call into the callbacks before the dictionary is,

pipenv/,98,"2. The callbacks don't mutate the dictionary, they only read from it, and",

pipenv/,312,"memory. That would be...uh...bad. Yeah, that's the word. Bad.",
pipenv/,335,We save off the previously-configured timeout and then set it to,

pipenv/,616,TODO: should I do clean shutdown here? Do I have to?,
pipenv/,635,"Urgh, annoying.",
pipenv/,636,,
pipenv/,637,Here's how we do this:,
pipenv/,638,,
pipenv/,639,1. Call SSLCopyPeerTrust to get hold of the trust object for this,

pipenv/,641,2. Call SecTrustGetCertificateAtIndex for index 0 to get the leaf.,
pipenv/,642,"3. To get the CN, call SecCertificateCopyCommonName and process that",

pipenv/,644,"4. To get the SAN, we need to do something a bit more complex:",
pipenv/,645,"a. Call SecCertificateCopyValues to get the data, requesting",

pipenv/,647,b. Mess about with this dictionary to try to get the SANs out.,
pipenv/,648,,
pipenv/,649,This is gross. Really gross. It's going to be a few hundred LoC extra,
pipenv/,650,just to repeat something that SecureTransport can *already do*. So my,
pipenv/,651,operating assumption at this time is that what we want to do is,
pipenv/,652,instead to just flag to urllib3 that it shouldn't do its own hostname,
pipenv/,653,validation when using SecureTransport.,
pipenv/,661,Grab the trust store.,
pipenv/,665,Probably we haven't done the handshake yet. No biggie.,
pipenv/,670,Also a case that might happen if we haven't handshaked.,
pipenv/,671,Handshook? Handshaken?,
pipenv/,677,"Ok, now we want the DER bytes.",
pipenv/,723,Platform-specific: Python 2,
pipenv/,730,Platform-specific: Python 3,
pipenv/,733,We disable buffering with SecureTransport because it conflicts with,
pipenv/,734,the buffering that ST does internally (see issue #1153 for more).,
pipenv/,776,"TODO: Well, crap.",
pipenv/,777,,
pipenv/,778,So this is the bit of the code that is the most likely to cause us,
pipenv/,779,trouble. Essentially we need to enumerate all of the SSL options that,
pipenv/,780,users might want to use and try to see if we can sensibly translate,
pipenv/,781,"them, or whether we should just ignore them.",
pipenv/,786,TODO: Update in line with above.,
pipenv/,798,"So, this has to do something a bit weird. Specifically, what it does",
pipenv/,799,is nothing.,
pipenv/,800,,
pipenv/,801,"This means that, if we had previously had load_verify_locations",
pipenv/,802,"called, this does not undo that. We need to do that because it turns",
pipenv/,803,out that the rest of the urllib3 code will attempt to load the,
pipenv/,804,"default verify paths if it hasn't been told about any paths, even if",
pipenv/,805,the context itself was sometime earlier. We resolve that by just,
pipenv/,806,ignoring it.,
pipenv/,813,"For now, we just require the default cipher string.",
pipenv/,818,"OK, we only really support cadata and cafile.",
pipenv/,837,"So, what do we do here? Firstly, we assert some properties. This is a",
pipenv/,838,"stripped down shim, so there is some functionality we don't support.",
pipenv/,839,See PEP 543 for the real deal.,
pipenv/,844,"Ok, we're good to go. Now we want to create the wrapped socket object",
pipenv/,845,and store it in the appropriate place.,
pipenv/,848,Now we can handshake,

pipenv/,177,"Unfortunately, SecKeychainCreate requires a path to a keychain. This",
pipenv/,178,"means we cannot use mkstemp to use a generic temporary file. Instead,",
pipenv/,179,we're going to create a temporary directory and a filename to use there.,
pipenv/,180,This filename will be 8 random bytes expanded into base64. We also need,
pipenv/,181,"some random bytes to password-protect the keychain we're creating, so we",
pipenv/,182,ask for 40 random bytes.,
pipenv/,185,Must be valid UTF-8,

pipenv/,227,The keychain to insert into,

pipenv/,232,A CFArray is not very useful to us as an intermediary,
pipenv/,233,"representation, so we are going to extract the objects we want",
pipenv/,234,and then free the array. We don't need to keep hold of keys: the,
pipenv/,235,keychain already has them!,
pipenv/,263,"Ok, the strategy.",
pipenv/,264,,
pipenv/,265,This relies on knowing that macOS will not give you a SecIdentityRef,
pipenv/,266,unless you have imported a key into a keychain. This is a somewhat,
pipenv/,267,"artificial limitation of macOS (for example, it doesn't necessarily",
pipenv/,268,"affect iOS), but there is nothing inside Security.framework that lets you",
pipenv/,269,get a SecIdentityRef without having a key in a keychain.,
pipenv/,270,,
pipenv/,271,So the policy here is we take all the files and iterate them in order.,
pipenv/,272,Each one will use SecItemImport to have one or more objects loaded from,
pipenv/,273,it. We will also point at a keychain that macOS can use to work with the,
pipenv/,274,private key.,
pipenv/,275,,
pipenv/,276,"Once we have all the objects, we'll check what we actually have. If we",
pipenv/,277,"already have a SecIdentityRef in hand, fab: we'll use that. Otherwise,",
pipenv/,278,we'll take the first certificate (which we assume to be our leaf) and,
pipenv/,279,ask the keychain to give us a SecIdentityRef with that cert's associated,
pipenv/,280,key.,
pipenv/,281,,
pipenv/,282,We'll then return a CFArray containing the trust chain: one,
pipenv/,283,SecIdentityRef and then zero-or-more SecCertificateRef objects. The,
pipenv/,284,responsibility for freeing this CFArray will be with the caller. This,
pipenv/,285,"CFArray must remain alive for the entire connection, so in practice it",
pipenv/,286,"will be stored with a single SSLSocket, along with the reference to the",
pipenv/,287,keychain.,
pipenv/,291,Filter out bad paths.,
pipenv/,300,"Ok, we have everything. The question is: do we have an identity? If",
pipenv/,301,"not, we want to grab one from the first cert we have.",

pipenv/,18,How should we wait on sockets?,

pipenv/,20,There are two types of APIs you can use for waiting on sockets: the fancy,
pipenv/,21,"modern stateful APIs like epoll/kqueue, and the older stateless APIs like",
pipenv/,22,select/poll. The stateful APIs are more efficient when you have a lots of,
pipenv/,23,"sockets to keep track of, because you can set them up once and then use them",
pipenv/,24,lots of times. But we only ever want to wait on a single socket at a time,
pipenv/,25,"and don't want to keep track of state, so the stateless APIs are actually",
pipenv/,26,more efficient. So we want to use select() or poll().,
pipenv/,27,,
pipenv/,28,"Now, how do we choose between select() and poll()? On traditional Unixes,",
pipenv/,29,"select() has a strange calling convention that makes it slow, or fail",
pipenv/,30,"altogether, for high-numbered file descriptors. The point of poll() is to fix",
pipenv/,31,"that, so on Unixes, we prefer poll().",
pipenv/,32,,
pipenv/,33,"On Windows, there is no poll() (or at least Python doesn't provide a wrapper",
pipenv/,34,"for it), but that's OK, because on Windows, select() doesn't have this",
pipenv/,35,strange calling convention; plain select() works fine.,
pipenv/,36,,
pipenv/,37,"So: on Windows we use select(), and everywhere else we use poll(). We also",
pipenv/,38,fall back to select() in case poll() is somehow broken or missing.,
pipenv/,41,"Modern Python, that retries syscalls by default",
pipenv/,47,Old and broken Pythons.,
pipenv/,57,"OSError for 3 <= pyver < 3.5, select.error for pyver <= 2.7",

pipenv/,84,thing.),
pipenv/,101,"For some reason, poll() takes timeout in milliseconds",
pipenv/,115,Apparently some systems have a select.poll that fails as soon as you try,
