YouCompleteMe/python/ycm/omni_completer.py,74,Calling directly the omnifunc may move the cursor position. This is the,
YouCompleteMe/python/ycm/omni_completer.py,75,case with the default Vim omnifunc for C-family languages,
YouCompleteMe/python/ycm/omni_completer.py,76,(ccomplete#Complete) which calls searchdecl to find a declaration. This,
YouCompleteMe/python/ycm/omni_completer.py,77,function is supposed to move the cursor to the found declaration but it,
YouCompleteMe/python/ycm/omni_completer.py,78,doesn't when called through the omni completion mapping (CTRL-X CTRL-O).,
YouCompleteMe/python/ycm/omni_completer.py,79,"So, we restore the cursor position after the omnifunc calls.",
YouCompleteMe/python/ycm/omni_completer.py,85,Vim only stops completion if the value returned by the omnifunc is -3 or,
