NLP-progress/structured/export.py,90,Use the line before the table,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,94,exceptions:,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,135,only has author name,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,202,find the model name column (usually the first one),
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,234,now parse the table rows,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,243,extract all the metrics,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,248,extract paper references,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,251,extract model_name and author,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,263,and code links if they exist,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,295,"Main assumption is that the Sota table will minimally have a ""Model"" column",
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,332,Assumptions:,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,333,1) H1 are tasks,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,334,2) Everything until the next heading is the task description,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,335,"3) H2 are subtasks, H3 are datasets, H4 are subdatasets",
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,337,Algorithm:,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,338,1) Split the document by headings,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,355,2) Parse each heading section one-by-one,

NLP-progress/structured/export.py,410,new dataset and add,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,414,"we are in a task, add here",
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,422,dataset description is everything that's not a table,
NLP-progress/structured/export.py,426,see if there is an arxiv link in the first paragraph of the description,
